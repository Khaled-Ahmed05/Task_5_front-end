                            The French Bulldog (French: Bouledogue Fran√ßais) is a French breed  
                            of companion dog or toy dog. 

                            It appeared in Paris in the mid-nineteenth century, apparently the 
                            result of cross-breeding of Toy Bulldogs imported from England and 
                            local Parisian ratters.

                            It is commonly kept as a pet and is among the most frequently  
                            registered dogs in a number of countries including Australia, the  
                            United Kingdom, and the United States. 

                            The breed is susceptible to various health problems as a consequence  
                            of being bred for a distinctive appearance, sporting a brachycephalic 
                            face and skin wrinkles.

                        <p>
                            The Labrador Retriever, also known simply as the Labrador or Lab, 
                            is a British breed of retriever gun dog. 
                            
                            It was developed in the United Kingdom from St. John's water dogs 
                            imported from the colony of Newfoundland (now a province of Canada), 
                            and was named after the Labrador region of that colony. 
                                
                            It is among the most commonly kept dogs in several countries, 
                            particularly in the Western world. Labradors are often friendly, 
                            energetic, and playful. 
                                
                            It was bred as a sporting and hunting dog but is widely kept as a 
                            companion dog. Though content as a companion, these dogs are intelligent 
                            and require both physical and mental stimulation. 
                                
                            It may also be trained as a guide or assistance dog, or for rescue or 
                            therapy work.

                        <p>
                            The Golden Retriever is a Scottish breed of retriever dog of 
                            medium size. It is characterised by a gentle and affectionate 
                            nature and a striking golden coat. 
                                
                            It is a working dog, and registration is subject to successful 
                            completion of a working trial. It is commonly kept as a companion 
                            dog and is among the most frequently registered breeds in several 
                            Western countries; some may compete in dog shows or obedience trials, 
                            or work as guide dogs. 
                                
                            The Golden Retriever was bred by Sir Dudley Marjoribanks at his 
                            Scottish estate Guisachan in the late nineteenth century. 
                            He cross-bred Flat-coated Retrievers with Tweed Water Spaniels, with 
                            some further infusions of Red Setter, Labrador Retriever and Bloodhound. 
                                
                            It was recognised by the Kennel Club in 1913, and during the interwar 
                            period spread to many parts of the world.
